🏙️ Beijing Air Quality Analysis
Welcome to the Beijing Air Quality Analysis Application!
This interactive app based on streamlit provides insights into the air quality trends and patterns in Beijing, China between 2013 and 2017.

🎯 Purpose
This app aims to:
<br>
📊 Explore historical air quality data from various monitoring stations across Beijing.
📈 Visualize trends and patterns in key air pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3.
🏭 Identify stations and periods with the highest pollution levels.
🔗 Analyze the relationships between different pollutants.
🖥️ Provide an interface for interactive exploration and data visualization.

📂 Data Source
The data used in this app was collected from 12 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing between 2013 and 2017.
It includes hourly measurements of various pollutants and meteorological parameters like temperature, pressure, and wind speed.
The dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and preprocessed for this analysis.
